- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maida97
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming. My final goal (for now) is AI. (abmitious, I know)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of CS, and soon starting with my first programming language Java.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me.. well for now don't. I will share my contact, once I feel *useful* :p
